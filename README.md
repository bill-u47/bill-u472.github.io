# <p align="center">**This is not a working website nor a finished repository; it's simply to store my project in one place.** </p><br> 
## **<p align="center">If you want the website to work, these are the steps to run: </p>**              
**1. Download all files**          
**2. Make a .env file in the directory that you download the email system to, making a GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD variable (make an app password and title it whatever you like) and an EMAIL_ADDRESS variable.**        
**3. Run the Python file to initialize the server**        
**4. Finally, run the HTML file and enjoy!**
