**This is simply to store my project in one place. Steps to run:**
**1. Download all files**
**2. Make a .env file in the directory that you download the email system to, making a GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD variable (make an app password and title it whatever you like) and an EMAIL_ADDRESS variable.**
**3. Run the Python file to initialize the server**
**4. Finally, run the HTML file and enjoy!**
